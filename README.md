This is the Final Project for our group for ELEC 327 Spring 2025 Semester. The goal for the final project is to create a low-power embedded system that recreates the game of Tic-Tac-Toe in a fun way. We used an MSPM03507 Launchpad to interact with a PCB that we designed to activate a vibration motor. In order to activate the game, we used a 4x4 Adarfruit Neotrellis Board with elastometer and implemented the game state machine on the board using an Arduino Nano Every via I2C.
